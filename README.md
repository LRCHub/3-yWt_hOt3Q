[00:01.33] Fuck you and your mom and your sister and your job
[00:05.42] And your broke-ass car and that shit you call art
[00:09.34] Fuck you and your friends that I'll never see again
[00:13.20] Everybody but your dog, you can all fuck off
[00:35.20] 
[00:17.80] I swear I meant to mean the best when it ended
[00:21.71] Even tried to bite my tongue when you start shit
[00:25.72] Now you're texting all my friends asking questions
[00:29.23] They never even liked you in the first place
[00:33.79] Dated a girl that I hate for the attention
[00:37.38] She only made it two days, what a connection
[00:41.37] It's like you'd do anything for my affection
[00:44.95] You're going all about it in the worst ways
[01:06.45] 
[00:49.50] I was into you, but I'm over it now
[00:54.33] And I was tryna be nice
[00:57.44] But nothing's getting through, so let me spell it out
[01:23.94] 
[01:01.86] A-B-C-D-E, F-U
[01:05.49] And your mom and your sister and your job
[01:08.38] And your broke-ass car and that shit you call art
[01:12.20] Fuck you and your friends that I'll never see again
[01:16.29] Everybody but your dog, you can all fuck off
[01:38.29] 
[01:21.46] Nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah
[01:25.44] A-B-C-D-E, F-U
[01:32.44] 
[01:28.69] Now with my energy
[01:30.49] You and me, we're not the same
[01:32.23] Oh, you think that I'm the bitch
[01:34.10] Well, look in the mirror babe
[01:36.36] FYI, you're not my type
[01:38.19] PSA, your friends are lame
[01:40.27] You're bad in bed
[01:41.29] You suck at sex
[01:42.14] RIP, to me you're dead
[01:53.14] 
[01:44.70] I was into you, but I'm over it now
[01:49.41] And I was tryna be nice
[01:52.29] But nothing's getting through, so let me spell it out
[02:18.79] 
[01:56.91] A-B-C-D-E, F-U
[02:00.52] And your mom and your sister and your job
[02:03.50] And your Craigslist couch and the way your voice sounds
[02:07.43] Fuck you and your friends that I'll never see again

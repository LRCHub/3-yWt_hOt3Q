[00:01.48] Fuck you and your mom and your sister and your job
[00:05.47] And your broke-ass car and that shit you call art
[00:09.56] Fuck you and your friends that I'll never see again
[00:13.53] Everybody but your dog, you can all fuck off
[00:35.53] 
[00:17.95] I swear I meant to mean the best when it ended
[00:22.25] Even tried to bite my tongue when you start shit
[00:25.80] Now you're texting all my friends asking questions
[00:29.46] They never even liked you in the first place
[00:33.97] Dated a girl that I hate for the attention
[00:37.61] She only made it two days, what a connection
[00:41.48] It's like you'd do anything for my affection
[00:45.06] You're going all about it in the worst ways
[01:06.56] 
[00:49.51] I was into you, but I'm over it now
[00:54.83] And I was tryna be nice
[00:57.41] But nothing's getting through, so let me spell it out
[01:23.91] 
[01:02.37] A-B-C-D-E, F-U
[01:05.79] And your mom and your sister and your job
[01:08.40] And your broke-ass car and that shit you call art
[01:12.40] Fuck you and your friends that I'll never see again
[01:16.13] Everybody but your dog, you can all fuck off
[01:38.13] 
[01:20.74] Nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah
[01:25.58] A-B-C-D-E, F-U
[01:32.58] 
[01:28.76] Now with my energy
[01:30.45] You and me, we're not the same
[01:32.70] Oh, you think that I'm the bitch
[01:34.40] Well, look in the mirror babe
[01:36.22] FYI, you're not my type
[01:38.49] PSA, your friends are lame
[01:40.25] You're bad in bed
[01:41.22] You suck at sex
[01:42.21] RIP, to me you're dead
[01:53.21] 
[01:44.82] I was into you, but I'm over it now
[01:49.79] And I was tryna be nice
[01:52.47] But nothing's getting through, so let me spell it out
[02:18.97] 
[01:57.26] A-B-C-D-E, F-U
[02:00.55] And your mom and your sister and your job
[02:03.51] And your Craigslist couch and the way your voice sounds
[02:07.35] Fuck you and your friends that I'll never see again
[02:11.50] Everybody but your dog, you can all fuck off
[02:33.50] 
[02:16.48] Nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah

[02:35.95] 
[02:32.19] And your mom and your sister and your job
[02:34.92] And your broke-ass car and that shit you call art
[02:39.05] Fuck you and your friends that I'll never see again
